email from Anna on 10.25.18 and other relevant info in that email thread:

Hi Kelly, 

Please see the attached prt files for an idea of when which condition was present in ADT and Prosody. The only caveat is that these prt files exclude the first two volumes (which were always just Rest), so when it says 

Rest was present from volumes 1 through 6, it actually means 3 through 8, etc.
So add 2 to all numbers to get the "true" volume, and assign the first 2 volumes to Rest.

Let me know if anything is unclear!

TR was 3 seconds for all.

Best,
Anna



Two runs of each should be the exception rather than the rule. They only differ in the order in which blocks are presented. In general, what comes from the scanner labeled "Prosody1" should be associated with a Prosody1 presentation output file and correspondingly the Prosody1.prt file is the appropriate one. Prosody2 goes with Prosody2. If there's Prosody3 and 4, 3 usually corresponds to 1 and 4 to 2, but it's safest to check the scanning logs.




emot is when they hear emotional sentences, then see a happy, sad, or angry symbol and have to say whether the emotion symbol matches the emotion.
ctrl is when they hear the same sentences in a neutral voice, then see a dinner plate, gift box, or van, and have to say whether the sentences was about food, a gift, or going somewhere.
instr is the short period at the beginning of each block when they see either all the emotion symbols or all the content symbols at the same time to tell them that the following block will be about emotion or content
during rest, they just see a fixation spot

so for your GLM, rest is the intercept, and the contrast of interest is emot > ctrl




ADT pre-Nov 2014, and post-Nov 2014 difference in timing - the conditions were exactly the same --- subjects 08, 09, 010, 011, and 012 had pre-Nov 2014
