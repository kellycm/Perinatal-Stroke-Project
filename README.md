Doctoral thesis work with Drs. Elissa Newport & Peter Turkeltaub

How does the brain organize after a stroke around the time of birth? After a LH stroke, how does the right hemisphere develop to accommodate language, which is typically left-lateralized, in addition to typically right-lateralized functions?

The Auditory Description Decision Task (Berl et al, 2014) has forward and reverse auditorily-presented sentences that robustly activate the language network in individual participants. I am analyzing this task fMRI data to compare the surviving right hemisphere of LH perinatal stroke participants to left and right hemisphere activity in healthy controls, as well as left hemisphere activity in RH stroke patients.

There is also an emotional prosody fMRI task that has a neutral sentence condition (respond whether you are going somewhere, eating something, or being gifted something), and an emotional sentence condition (decide whether it was happy, sad, or angry between two symbols representing two of these emotions). It typically slightly more right-lateralized than other types of linguistic sentence processing. How does this type of processing share space with typically left-lateralized processing, such as that seen in response to ADDT?
